GIT_ASKPASS
           If this environment variable is set, then Git commands which need to acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP
           authentication) will call this program with a suitable prompt as command-line argument and read the password from its STDOUT. See also
           the core.askpass option in git-config(1).
