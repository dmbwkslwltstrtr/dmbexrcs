I want to process traditional Mongolian text in Fedora 25+ using LibreOffice 5.2.5.1 20(Build:1) or above.<br>
The IME is **fcitx**, with input language/source "Mongolian mn" added.<br>
I did all the steps stated at *[traditional Mongolian driver for Ubuntu][1]*, but can't input the vertical script at all.<br>
Relevant part of ***/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml*** is:<br>

    <layout>
    <configitem>
    <name>mn</name>
    <shortdescription>mn</shortdescription>
    <description>Mongolian</description>
    <languagelist>
    <iso639id>mon</iso639id>
    </languagelist>
    </configitem>
    <variantlist/>
    </layout>
    
    <layout>
    <configitem>
    <name>ms</name>
    <shortdescription>ms</shortdescription>
    <description>MongolianScript</description>
    <languagelist>
    <iso639id>mon</iso639id>
    </languagelist>
    </configitem>
    <variantlist/>
    </layout>

locale:<br>

    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8

I submitted my problems and questions on that site, still haven't gotten reply.<br>
The reason I'm not using Ubuntu is because of persistent mysterious Wifi and github disconnectivity problem,i.e. Wifi suddenly goes off or push to github repeatedly fails with "unable to resolve host github.com" when Wifi is connected.<br>
Fedora may not be the problem, I suspect my FCITX configuration is problematic. ***If*** the FCITX entry for Mongolian is "**ms**"(the file which is copied to ***/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols*** as given in the first URL: [http://www.mongoltolbo.com/ubuntu-mongol-bichgiin-gariin-draiver][1] ) ***not*** "mn", maybe possible to input vertical Mongolian, isn't it?<br>
I set up FCITX following <br>
[https://srobb.net/jpninpt.html#Fedora][2]<br>and<br>
[https://blogs.fsfe.org/stefan.a/2014/09/23/set-up-fcitx-chinese-and-japanese-language-input-ubuntu-14-04/][3]
<br>
Finally, IBus isn't uninstalled.<p>
I came across a github repo about vertical typesetting, [https://github.com/andreas-vox/ScribusCTL][4], the content and all the above problems are way above my comprehension.<br>Using Windows or Mac OSX is impossible for me now.<p>
I genuinely appreciate any suggestion, advice and correction for the causes of and solutions for my problems and theory & practice for vertical text processing in Fedora 25+ with LibreOffice 5.2.5+.<br>Thanks in advance.
