=PMT(rate, number of payments, -amount) returns the payment on a loan.
For example the monthly payment on a 30 year mortgage of $500,000 at 4% would be
=PMT(4%/12, 360, -500000)
The interest rate is the annual rate but we are looking for a monthly payment so we divide by 12. A 30 year mortgage has 360 monthly payments. The function produces negative amounts so the principal amount must be entered as a negative to output a positive payment.
